#TIC TAC TOE

A simple TicTacToe program with nice console output written using C++.

##Introduction
A Tic Tac Toe program lets the user choose his/her piece on a 3X3 board. Your goal is to align 3 of the same piece in a row/column/diagonal to win the game.

The computer (BAD GUY) will try to either win its own by doing the same, or it will block your winning ways. 

Try to beat it!
